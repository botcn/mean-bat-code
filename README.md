# Screen virus
what it does is reruns its self a lot so you can stop it then it twitches your screen a lot by turning off explorer and turning it back off and goes into your startups so you cant escape it also it will slow down your apps from the spam and switching also you can escape by powering off and back on your laptop or pc and quickly disabling the start up if you start up quick it might be late but you can still do it. I will be updating it so you cant disable the start up.
# cmd bar spam
